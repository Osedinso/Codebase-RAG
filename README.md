<h3>CodebaseGPT: AI-Powered Code Understanding Assistant</h3>
🔗 Live Demo: Try it here
CodebaseGPT is an intelligent chatbot that helps developers understand and navigate codebases using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). By combining vector similarity search with large language models, it provides contextually relevant answers about your code.
🌟 Features

Chat interface for natural language queries about your codebase
Smart code retrieval using vector similarity search
Context-aware responses powered by LLMs
Support for multiple programming languages
Real-time code search and explanation
Suggestions for code improvements
Integration with development workflows

🛠️ Technology Stack

Backend: Python with FastAPI/Flask
Frontend: React with Next.js
Vector Database: Pinecone
Embeddings: OpenAI/Hugging Face
LLM Integration: GPT-3.5/GPT-4
Code Processing: LangChain

🚀 Getting Started

Clone the repository
Install dependencies
Set up your environment variables
Initialize Pinecone database
Start the development server
🎯 How It Works

Code Embedding: Your codebase is processed and converted into vector embeddings
Vector Storage: Embeddings are stored in Pinecone for efficient similarity search
Query Processing: User questions are converted to vectors and matched with relevant code
Response Generation: LLM generates helpful responses using retrieved code context

💡 Use Cases

Understanding new codebases quickly
Finding specific implementations
Learning code patterns and architecture
Identifying areas for improvement
Technical documentation assistance
Code review support
